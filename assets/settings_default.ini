[AI Settings]

	# The model used by OpenAI to generate the text.
	# Default is 'gpt-3.5-turbo' because everyone can access it. If you have access, GPT-4 is recommended. 
	# See this page for more info about the other models: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart

	# Controls the randomness of the AI text generation.
	# Lowering results in less random completions. Higher temperature results in more random completions.
	# Default is 1.0.
Temperature = 1.0

	# The AI image generator service to use.
	# Possible Values: "openai", "stability", and "clipdrop"
